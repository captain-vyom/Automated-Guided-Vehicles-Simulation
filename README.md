# Automated-Guided-Vehicles-Simulation
This is the simulation model for the Aumated Guided Vehicles system

The green rectangle point represent pods.
The blue rectangle point represent picking station.
The pink rectangle point represent replenishing station.
The moving points represents automated guided vehicles. When it is black, it has no pods in itself.
When it loads with pods, it turns red. when it turn yellow from red, this means it has finished picking task or replenishing task and it return pods to pods storage spots.
